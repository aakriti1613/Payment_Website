Key Features:
1. Multi-Account Payment: Users can make payments from more than one account simultaneously, distributing the amount in predefined ratios.
2. Single UPIN Authentication: A secure UPIN is used to authenticate large transactions, simplifying the payment process.
3. User-Friendly Interface: The platform includes multiple well-structured pages for easy navigation:
Landing Page: The homepage introduces the service with key features and benefits.
